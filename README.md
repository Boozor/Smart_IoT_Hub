# Smart_IoT_Hub
Leveraged Java full stack web application frameworks to develop a smart hub for Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT_Hub consists of a frontend web application that allows users to control and monitor their IoT devices. Also, a server backend is built as a Spring Boot application to provide RESTful services to the frontend web application. It can also communicate with one or more IoT simulators via MQTT broker to control and report its status. After passing identity verification during user login, a user can get into the dashboard page to monitor the state and power consumption of each switch in real time through the web page on their phones or  tab. A user can also see the real-time information of plugs, and also can click the button in webpage to control them directly. This IoT_Hub is compatible to work with devices of any type of vendor.
